### About
This mod restores access to the Hammer. It is more optimized than the old hammer, however there is a small chance that you may encounter lag.

### NOTES
-Will not work in locked rooms.

-The color slider is a bit buggy in the animation but it still works.

-Most of the time you will need to *yeet* the hammer for it to blow stuff up, however there is a chance that you don't need to yeet it and can keep it in hand.

-The hammer emoji sometimes falls behind the color picker baground, however the button is still functional.

-Other's cannot see your hammer.

-Don't use this for griefing. Be responsible with it.
